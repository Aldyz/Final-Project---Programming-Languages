DT is an iteration/cycle process.
Requirements for DT: confidence, exp, optimism, designt thinking mindset
DT Mindset: focus on human values, craft clarity (produce a coherent vision from messy problems), collaborate across boundaries (bring innovators with varied bgs), show dont tell (creating experiences and using illutrative visuals, telling good stories communicate your vision in an impactful way), bias towards action (dt is a misnomer(misunderstanding, misleading) it is more about thinking n acting, bias towards doing), embrace experimentation (prototyping is not simply a way to validate your idea; it is an integral part of your innovation process) be mindful of process (know where you are in the design process, what methods to use and what your goals are)
